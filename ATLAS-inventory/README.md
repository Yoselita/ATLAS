# Inventory of CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX datasets used in the ATLAS

The inventories of model simulations used in the ATLAS for the different experiments and scenarios are included here, indicating the availability of the different variables as well as auxiliary fixed fields, such as the land/sea mask (sftlf). The documents CMIP5/CMIP6/CORDEX_simulations_ATLAS.xlxs provide a full overview of the simulations available. 

Full metadata is organized as (machine readable) tables in the different CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX folders. This includes the ESGF version used for each model and variable so the data is fully traceable. CMIP6 includes different temporal frequencies (day/mon) and realms (atmos, land, ocean, seaIce).

The data consolidated in the ATLAS is a subset of the data available at ESGF for the relevant experiments used in the ATLAS and is updated periodically. A parallel inventory of ESGF availability is maintained in 'ESGF-inventory' in order to check the available updates.
