#' @title Global Warming Level timing calculation
#' @description Atomic function to compute the timing of a user-defined Global Warming Level.
#' @param data A named numeric vector of mean global annual temperature projections. Names are years.
#' @param base.period Integer vector of length two, indicating the star/end year of the pre-industrial baseline period. Default to \code{c(1850, 1900)}
#' @param proj.period Same as \code{base.period}, but for the projected period.
#' @param window Integer. Moving window width (in years). Default to 20.
#' @param GWL Floating point number indicating the global warming level (degrees)
#' @return The central year of the interval for which the specified GWL is reached. NA if the GWL is not reached within the projected period.
#' In addition, an attribute (\code{"interval"}) provides the closed interval boundaries.
