## The Multi-MIP Climate Change ATLAS

The Climate Change ATLAS is an initiative to develop **tools and ready-to-use datasets** for reproducible regional analysis of observed and model projected (CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX) climate change information using both time-slices (e.g. 2081-2100) and warming levels (e.g. +1.5º). A **new set of sub-continental reference regions** is provided as the basis for regional synthesis (building on IPCC AR5 reference regions) and monthly spatially aggregated datasets are produced to facilitate the development of regional climate change information. 

The **accessibility and reproducibility** of results has been a major concern during the development of the Climate Change ATLAS, in order to ensure the transparency of the products (which are all publicly available). The Atlas products are generated using **free software community tools**, in particular [R](https://www.r-project.org) building on the [**climate4R** framework](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R) for data post-processing (data access, regridding, aggregation, bias adjustment, etc.) and evaluation and quality control (when applicable). **Provenance/ metadata** is generated using the [**METACLIP**](http://www.metaclip.org) RDF-based framework (building on the [metaclipR](https://github.com/metaclip/metaclipR) package for the climate4R framework).

### New Reference Regions 
A new set of reference regions is produced building on the popular [AR5 IPCC reference regions](http://www.ipcc-data.org/guidelines/pages/ar5_regions.html) developed for reporting sub-continental CMIP5 (with typical resolution of 2º) projections over a reduced number of regions. The increased reasolution (typically 1º in CMIP6) allows to increase the number of regions for a better climatic representatio (this results in **46 land and 14 ocean reference regions**). The coordinates (csv and shapefile) of the regions and related datasets are available at the **'reference-regions'** repo.

### Regional Aggregated datasets (CMIP and CORDEX)
The IPCC reference regions have been used as the basis to generate popular spatially aggregated datasets, such as the [IPCC AR5 seasonal mean temperature and precipitation in IPCC regions for CMIP5](https://catalogue.ceda.ac.uk/uuid/9d0f61dc7a1b4017b22d88f9d38ab398). Here we provide a updated version of this dataset using CMIP6 projections (interpolated to a common 1º resolution, see **'referece_masks'**) for the new regions. Monthly mean values are stored for CMIP5/6 for the historical (1850-2005/1850-2014) and future RCP2.6/SSP1-2.6, RCP4.5/SSP2-4.5 and RCP8.5/SSP5-8.5 scenarios. This will later extended to CORDEX datasets. An inventory of the currently available models and runs is available at the **'ATLAS-inventory'**.

Besides the analysis of time-slices (e.g. near-, mid- and long-term, 2021-2040, 2041-2060, 2081-2100, respectively), we also provide information to work with Global Warming Levels (+1.5º, +2º, +3º, +4º); see **'warming-levels'**.

### Scripts and notebooks
Scripts and (jupyter) notebooks are provided in the different sections to ensure reproducibility and reusability of the results.

### Virtual Workspace: The Atlas Hub
The Atlas Hub is a cloud facility providing virtual workspace for the Climate Change Atlas code and data (with preinstalled software and accesible data). The Atlas Hub is based on **Jupyter** to create and run notebooks on a remote machine where all the software is pre-installed. The Atlas Hub builds on the R **climate4R** package, allowing for transparent climate data access, collocation, post-processing (including bias adjustment) and visualization. Instructions to start working with the Hub are available at the [climate4R GitHub repository](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/climate4R).
