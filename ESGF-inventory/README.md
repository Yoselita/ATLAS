# Inventory of ESGF Datasets

This folder provides inventories in csv format of model simulations available at the Earth System Grid Federation ([ESGF](https://esgf.llnl.gov)). This is maintained to keep track of the information available in CMIP and CORDEX initiatives in order to plan downloading and consolidation in the ATLAS dataset.
