## Scripts for ATLAS figure and intermediate data generation

End-to-end scripts used for the preparation of the figures of the ATLAS chapter and the intermediate data (ATLAS-dataset) underpinning the Interactive Atlas. The Atlas dataset is formed by monthly values of CMIP5/6 and CORDEX for different variables and indices interpolated to common grids (2º, 1º, and 0.5º for CMIP5, CMIP6 and CORDEX, respectively). The scripts document the whole process, from data access to index calculation (and postprocessing –e.g. bias adjustment– if needed).
