# Interpolation ATLAS
Scripts used for the conservative interpolation of the CORDEX files done for ATLAS

All the raw model outputs used in ATLAS from the CMIP5, CMIP6 and CODEX experiments have been interpolated to a common grid using the fist order conservative remapping with [cdo](https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/projects/cdo/)

**CMIP5** data have been interpolated to the 2 degree common grid: [land_sea_mask_2degree_binary.nc4](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/blob/master/reference-grids/land_sea_mask_2degree_binary.nc4)
with [AtlasCDOremappeR_CMIP.sh](https://github.com/Yoselita/ATLAS/blob/patch-1/scripts/ATLAS-data/bash-interpolation-scripts/AtlasCDOremappeR_CMIP.sh)

**CMIP6** data have been interpolated to the 1 degree common grid: [land_sea_mask_1degree_binary.nc4](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/blob/master/reference-grids/land_sea_mask_1degree_binary.nc4), 
atmospheric data with [AtlasCDOremappeR_CMIP.sh](https://github.com/Yoselita/ATLAS/blob/patch-1/scripts/ATLAS-data/bash-interpolation-scripts/AtlasCDOremappeR_CMIP.sh) and 
the outputs from the ocean models [AtlasCDOremappeR_CMIP6_Omon.sh](https://github.com/Yoselita/ATLAS/blob/patch-1/scripts/ATLAS-data/bash-interpolation-scripts/AtlasCDOremappeR_CMIP6_Omon.sh).

**CORDEX** data have been interpolated to the 0.5 degree common grid: [land_sea_mask_05degree.nc](https://github.com/IPCC-WG1/Atlas/blob/master/reference-grids/land_sea_mask_05degree.nc4) 
with [AtlasCDOremapperR_CORDEX](https://github.com/Yoselita/ATLAS/blob/patch-1/scripts/ATLAS-data/bash-interpolation-scripts/AtlasCDOremappeR_CORDEX/AtlasCDOremapperR_CORDEX.sh).

All the scripts used for the interpolation follow guidelines for the interpolation coordinated within the CORDEX community.

Certain model grids from the models in CORDEX experiment were missing information on the coordinates of the grid corners for each grid cell - necessary for the conservative interpolation (e.g. ALADIN, ALARO, NCAR-WRF and RegCM4). In such cases a python script [grid_bounds_calc.py](https://github.com/Yoselita/ATLAS/blob/patch-1/scripts/ATLAS-data/bash-interpolation-scripts/AtlasCDOremappeR_CORDEX/grid_bounds_calc.py), based on the script provided by Caillaud CÃ©cile (cecile.caillaud@meteo.fr) and Samuel Somot (samuel.somot@meteo.fr) from Meteo France, were used to fill the info gap.
