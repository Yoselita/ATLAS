# Code for reproducibility of the ATLAS Map figures of model projections

Map figures of model projections are generated with `script4_map_figures.R` from the intermediate ATLAS dataset (used in the Interactive Atlas). Therefore it is available under the [**ATLAS-data folder**](https://github.com/SantanderMetGroup/ATLAS/tree/devel/scripts/ATLAS-data) together with the scripts for the reproducibility of the ATLAS-dataset.
